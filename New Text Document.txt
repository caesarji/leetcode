"Some men are definitely intelligent, others are definitely not intelligent, but of intermediate men, we should say, 'intelligent'? Yes, I think, so or no, I shouldn't be inclined to call him intelligent."
Which of the following reflects the intention of the writer well?
To call men intelligent who are not strikingly so must be to use the concept with undue imprecision
Every empirical concept has a degree of vagueness    
Calling someone intelligent or not depends upon one's whim
There is no need to be as indecisive as the writer of the above
